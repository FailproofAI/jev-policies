/**
 * The semantic (Jev) half of FailproofAI/jev-policies.
 *
 * A faithful translation of the compiled-in `SEMANTIC_POLICIES` from
 * `src/hooks/semantic/policies.ts` into the pack-declared form. Sixteen policies,
 * the same sixteen, in the same order.
 *
 * WHY THE WORDING IS FROZEN. Every probe below is a classifier input, and the
 * thresholds that read its answer (`decide.ts`: fire 0.70, deny 0.85, exempt 0.50,
 * userAsked 0.80, scope 0.80) were measured against this exact text. Rewording a
 * probe does not make the policy stricter or looser in any legible way — it moves
 * an unmeasured distance in an unknown direction. One dimension per probe, and a
 * policy fires only when EVERY probe holds (the minimum over probes), which is what
 * lets each question stay narrow and literal. Say what a thing is NOT in `criteria`,
 * because Jev answers the question as written.
 *
 * Installing this pack REPLACES the compiled-in set wholesale (contract §5), so this
 * file is the whole semantic tier, not an addition to it. Requires failproofai
 * >= 1.0.7-beta.0 — the beta cut from the branch that adds pack-declared semantic
 * policies. An older CLI ignores the `semantic` array silently, so none of these
 * sixteen is ever asked and the install still reports success — see the README.
